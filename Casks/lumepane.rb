  caveats <<~EOS
    LumePane is a paid app with a 14-day, fully featured trial.
    Purchase (one-time, no subscription): https://lumepane.com/checkout?src=brew

    Note: the activation record lives in the login keychain, so `brew uninstall --zap`
    removes the app's files but not that record. Remove it in Keychain Access if you
    want a completely clean state.
